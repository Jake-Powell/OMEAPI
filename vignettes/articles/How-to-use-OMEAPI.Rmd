# Authentication

OME requires you to get have an API token, an alphanumeric string that you need to send in every request. You will need to contact the OME data manager for create a token for you.

Keep this token private. You can pass the token in to each function via the token parameter, but itâ€™s better to store the token either as a environment variable (OME_CS_TOKEN). 

```{r}
OMEAPI::set_token('TOKEN_VALUE_HERE')
```

Once set you no longer need to pass the token to individual functions. This wil persist until the session is ended.
